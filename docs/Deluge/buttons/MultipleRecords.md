# Create a button that will handle multiple records

Loop through the record id list that is passed in and then grab the full record based on the ID.

```
IdsList = input.id.toList("|||"); /* This will be the parameter you give the function */
for each recId in IdsList
{
/* Put Logic In here */
}
return "Success";

```
